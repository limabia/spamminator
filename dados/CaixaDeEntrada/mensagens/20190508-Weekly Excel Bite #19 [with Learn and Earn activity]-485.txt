At the end of the video, you will find details of this week's Excel Learn and Earn Activity. You will also find a table of data that you can quickly copy and paste into Excel to carry out the Activity. This week there is a bonus reward for those that take part in the learn and earn activity as I have added a STEEM bounty to the post. If you are not familiar with our Learn and Earn activities you can find out more in this article.

I hope that you enjoy this weeks learning resource.  Talk again next week
