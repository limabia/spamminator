Hi Ricardo,

Do you think companies can find better candidates by improving their job postings? We hope to create an open-sourced body of work focused on this topic by hosting another Data Science for Good competition, this time in partnership with the City of Los Angeles.

Competition Description:  

The City of Los Angeles faces a big hiring challenge: one third of its 50,000 workers are eligible to retire by July of 2020. The city has partnered with Kaggle to create a competition to improve the job bulletins it will use to fill all those open positions.

The content, tone, and format of job descriptions can influence the quality of the applicant pool. Overly-specific requirements, for example, may discourage diversity. The Los Angeles Mayor’s Office wants to reimagine the city’s job bulletins by using text analysis to identify where they can improve.

The goal is to convert a folder full of plain-text job postings into a structured CSV file and then to use this data to: (1) identify language that can negatively bias the pool of applicants; (2) improve the diversity and quality of the applicant pool; and/or (3) make it easier to determine which promotions are available to employees in each job class.

Main Prizes:

The Los Angeles Mayor's Office of Budget and Innovation will award $15,000 in total prizes to five winning authors who submit public Kernels that tackle the objective effectively. The contest launches on May 8th, with final submissions due by June 21st.

Prizes:

    1st place: $5,000
    2nd place: $4,000
    3rd place: $3,000
    4th place: $1,500
    5th place: $1,500

Join the competition

Good luck!
