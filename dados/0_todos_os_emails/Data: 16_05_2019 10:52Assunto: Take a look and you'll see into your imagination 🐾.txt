Take a look and you'll see into your imagination 🐾

Before the web, some kids made spaceships out of moving boxes, created robots out of K'Nex, and channeled their inner Macaulay Culkin to keep bad guys away. Imaginations ran free. 

And they still do. While too much screen time can harm kids, we see projects on Devpost every week that help young humans live a better, happier, and healthier life:

🐰 Fuzzy Tales - David built an Alexa skill for kids that tells a fun story and teaches some important life lessons.

🍪 CookieSmart - Paurush was inspired by his daughters to create a way to easily collect, track, and submit girl scout cookie orders. 

🧪 Busy Hands - Cara is inspiring kids to develop an interest in STEM with different science projects using Alexa.

🧠 bSmart Smart Diabetes Management System - Abraham developed this IoT device to help manage his daughter’s Type 1 diabetes. 

Are children your inspiration? Show us! Build a project using your most wild, playful, and spirited self.
