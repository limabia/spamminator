Devpost hacker's choice awards üòÉ

We're starting a hacker's choice award for the rest of the season! Every week we'll pick opted-in hackathons and have hackers like their favorite projects. At the end of the week we'll tally up the likes (we do not include likes for yourself).

The winners will be featured in our newsletter each week.

Pro tip: make sure your hackathon organizers announce their winners on the site otherwise your projects won't be eligible!
