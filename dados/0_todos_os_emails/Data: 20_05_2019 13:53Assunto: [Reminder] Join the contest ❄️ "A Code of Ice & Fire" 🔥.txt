	INVITATION
May 2019
Hello,

The community contest A Code of Ice & Fire just started. It's a game of territory conquest on a grid. You train units and make them move to extend your control of the map and crush your opponent.

If you don't know where to start and you don't want to lose time, you can use one of the basic AIs of the starter kit. Else, here is some advice:

    Start by storing the inputs (grid, units, buildings) in appropriate data structures.
    Divide your strategy in two parts: training units, then moving them. No need to code pathfinding since it's included in the MOVE action.
    Prefer neutral and enemy tiles to extend your territory. It earns you gold.
    Analyze your game replays to understand how to improve your strategy.

Good luck!
Thibaud
