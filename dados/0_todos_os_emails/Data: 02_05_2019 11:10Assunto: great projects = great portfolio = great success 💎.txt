great projects = great portfolio = great success 💎

Hopefully a hackathon will mark the beginning of your project, not the end. Continuing work on your project helps you learn, improve your craft, and apply for a job. Here’s what you can do on Devpost when the hackathon is over:

    🎥 Add a demo video and additional images to give everyone an inside look at the project

    ✏️ Use the Updates feature to notify your followers of new changes

    🦁 List your contributions to let people know what you accomplished

    📋 Show your work by adding a link to your repo

Revamping your project pages leads to a better portfolio. Check out how these hackers are using their project pages to create robust Devpost portfolios:
