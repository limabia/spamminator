Hi @rafernandesjr,

We're excited to let you know about the launch of a series of new competitions for the 6th edition of the Fine-Grained Visual Categorization Workshop at CVPR this summer.

This Yearâ€™s Challenges
This year there will be a wide variety of competition topics, each highlighting unique challenges of fine-grained visual categorization, including iNaturalist, iMet (Kernels Only), and iMaterialist Fashion. With ten challenges to choose from, you're sure to find one (or many!) worth competing in.


Get Started Now
With just weeks left to go, you won't want to miss out!
