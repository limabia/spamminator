Hello,

Today's article is about genetic algorithms. If you don't know anything about them, don't worry! Di_Masta explained, with the help of nice gifs, how he used them to solve the famous Mars Lander puzzle.

What strikes me in Di_Masta's article is his determination: how he kept looking for solutions to the issues he encountered. Master class!

Happy reading,
Thibaud
