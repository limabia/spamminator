Hi @rafernandesjr,

We're excited to let you know about the launch of a new playground competition, Recognizing Faces in the Wild, hosted by The SMILE Lab at Northeastern. Click the button at the bottom of this email to learn more and get started!

About the Competition
Do you have your father's nose? In this competition, youâ€™ll help researchers build a more complex model by determining if two people are blood-related based solely on images of their faces. If you think you can get it "on the nose," this competition is for you.

About the Host:
The SMILE Lab at Northeastern focuses on the frontier research of applied machine learning, social media analytics, human-computer interaction, and high-level image and video understanding. Their research is driven by the explosion of diverse multimedia from the Internet, including both personal and publicly-available photos and videos. They start by treating fundamental theory from learning algorithms as the soul of machine intelligence and arm it with visual perception.


Next Important Deadline:
August 1, 2019 - Entry deadline. 
Join the competition


Good luck,

Sohier Dane
