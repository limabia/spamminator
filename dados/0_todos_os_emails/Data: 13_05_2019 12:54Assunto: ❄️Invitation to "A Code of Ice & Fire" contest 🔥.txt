	INVITATION
May 2019

Hello,

The AI game A Code Of Ice & Fire starts next Friday and will last for 10 days: from May 17 to May 27.

I know that AI can sometimes feel overwhelming so here's some advice:

    🕹 No pressure
    Yes, it's a multiplayer competition, but it's just a game. So relax. Set yourself an achievable goal and have fun.
    🙌 You're not alone
    A coding contest is a great opportunity to meet other coders. On the chat, on Discord, in a CodingHub... The community keeps me motivated.
    🚀 The "lazy" way
    How can you started in an apparently complex game? One step at a time, with simple ideas and all the way to Legend league. It's possible, Bob proved it during our last contest.

See you next week!
Thibaud
