One of the main advantages of using this tool for cloning is that it automatically scales the destination partition according to the need without you having to worry much about the details. You can migrate your system and boot partitions from a 1TB HDD to a 64GB SSD (or vice versa) for faster boot times, and the software will automatically take care of the partitioning.
