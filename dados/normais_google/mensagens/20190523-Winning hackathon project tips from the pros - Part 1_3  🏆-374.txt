Winning hackathon project tips from the pros - Part 1/3  🏆
This week we’re starting a 3 part series that will feature advice for winning hackathons. Over the next few weeks you’ll hear from:

    Hackers and Organizers
    Our own hackathon experts at Devpost
    Judges

We asked expert hackers and organizers what it takes to make a winning project. Here’s what they had to say: 

🚀 Stick to your story. To me it’s always the best pitch that wins. Stick to a single-track story that covers your idea’s main selling points and is presented entirely through a demo of your product.  - Stuart Olivera F8 Hackathon Winner

⚾️ Build what you care about. Really throw your passion and personal experiences into your vision for your project. If you can find that emotional connection or passion you can move mountains within those mere 24 hours. - Chris B. MLH Coach / Hackathon Organizer

🏗 Just keep building. No matter what, focus on creating value, and finish your project. When it isn't working out, pivot or re-align the goals of your project to what you can realistically wrap up in what time you have. - Yosun Chang Hacker Extraordinaire

👾 Teamwork makes the dream work. Be open to new suggestions and compromise when working with a team whom you’ve never worked with before.  - David Quach Hacker, Maker, Organizer

😎 Presentation, impact, and having fun. Most of the time winning consists of strong presentation skills, nicely designed wow factors, and a dash of good luck. Most importantly, you need to have fun and learn! - Sneha Vaswani Hacker, Organizer, Apple Engineer Ninja

Stay tuned next week for tips from the Devpost team
