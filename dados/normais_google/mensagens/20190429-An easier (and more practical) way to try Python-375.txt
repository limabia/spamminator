Hi Ricardo,

Do you have a lot of spare time, or are you busy?

If you said you have a lot of spare time, conventional Python books and courses are perfect for you. You’ll spend hours (maybe weeks) learning different parts of the programming language and of computer science. Though you might be on your own to learn practical applications.

And what if you said you’re busy? We’re releasing an ultra-short micro-course that gives you a fast way to try Python and start using it for data visualization. You’ll make your first visualizations in about the time it takes to drink your morning coffee. Soon after that you’ll find yourself with a large toolbox of graphing techniques.

This micro-course won’t teach you computer science, and it skips most parts of the Python programming language. But you’ll learn enough to impress colleagues or potential employers with nicer graphics than anyone makes in Excel.

Once you start using Python, you'll learn more as you use it for your projects. So if you're busy, and want to quickly build useful coding skills, this micro-course is for you.
Data Visualization: From Non-Coder to Coder


If you take this quick-start approach and find yourself using Python regularly for work projects or a personal portfolio, send us an email. We love hearing your success stories!

P.S. Want a middle ground to learning Python? We have a full Python course where you'll learn the major parts of the language at a faster pace than what you’ll find elsewhere.
